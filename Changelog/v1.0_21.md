* Being a better citizen to the platform by clearing caches under memory constraint conditions
* Better refreshing on the Timeline when having >500 albums
* Smarter and less frequent persisting of caches to disk
* Showing a progress Hud when a task is launched from the background
	* As when Spotify starts loading (Session renew, Artist load) when off screen
* Progress Hud after Spotify login
* Progress Hud on first launch when setting up the User and initial Artists
	* delete and redownload the App to test this - you'll loose all your current favorites
* Adding a Spinner to the Artwork cells to indicate loading
* color for the release date label and the Album Info are chosen more carefully
	* much better contrast on very monotone album art (ex. Metallica Black Album)
