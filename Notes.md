Code.todo

* Draw the UI for the App FIRST!
	* Because you focus on solving the wrong problems if you don't!
* [Using a CollectionView instead of a TableView with CoreData](http://ashfurrow.com/blog/uicollectionview-example)
* Get the AlbumView using a UICollectionView backed by the NSFetchedResultsController (CoreData) working (see links from nshipster and ash furrow) @done
* Stop focusing on the current problem of have weird sorting and stuff. What you do might seem simple but is really not. Since this is not what is should look like, more a playground, STOP FOCUSING ON SOLVING IT.
* opensource UIRefreshControl utility
* add the change to AFNetworking
